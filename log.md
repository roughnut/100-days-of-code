### Day 9: January 17, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started freeCodeCamp portfolio project & struggled with vertical & center alignment of images in containers.

**Thoughts** I would have thought it'd be easier in Bootstrap to align images in the dead-centre of a container.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Practicing Bootstrap on an old website I'd coded using HTML and CSS only.

**Thoughts** Bootstrap saves a lot of time. Still can't work out how to "middle" text in a nav next to an image. Will work on that tomorrow.
