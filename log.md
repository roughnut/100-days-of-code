### Day 2: January 4, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on replacing much of CSS in site with Bootstrap classes. Spending quite a bit of time on Stack Overflow.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Practicing Bootstrap on an old website I'd coded using HTML and CSS only.

**Thoughts** Bootstrap saves a lot of time. Still can't work out how to "middle" text in a nav next to an image. Will work on that tomorrow.
